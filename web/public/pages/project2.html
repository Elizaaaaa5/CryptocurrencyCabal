        <h1 class="entry-title">Project 2 - Mining Points</h1>
        <p><div class="due">
Part 1 Due: <strong>Sunday, 22 February</strong>; Part 2 Due: <strong>Thursday, 5 March</strong>
   </div></p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understand how cryptocurrency mining works by building and running a
miner for a new cryptocurrency.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore some potential threats to bitcoin by attempting attacks on our
class cryptocurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get some experience using cloud computing resources and understanding 
  computing costs in practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>For Part 1 of this assignment, everyone should create and run their own
PointCoin miner, and writeup their own answers to the questions.</p>
<p>You may, and are encouraged to, discuss all of the problems with anyone
else you want (both on-line using the course web site or any other means
you choose, and in person), and it is okay to share code with others so
long as you understand everything in all of the code you use.</p>
<p>For Part 2, you may work with others in the class (indeed, part of your
goal for part 2 is to form a mining coallition with enough power to
disrupt the normal behavior of the network).  You should not start Part
2 or make any attempts to (intentionally) disrupt the PointCoin network
until the announced starting time for Part 2 (which will be announced
later in class).</p>
<h1>Part 1: Mining PointCoin</h1>
<p><div class="exercise"> </p>
<p><strong>Set up your pointcoind node.</strong> Following the instructions below, set
up your pointcoind node and wallet.  After finishing this, <a href="http://bitcoin-class.org/pages/project-2-pointcoin-nodes.html">post a
comment here</a> with the public IP address
of your EC2 node.</p>
</div>

<p>To set up your pointcoind node:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Setup an EC2 instance, install go and pointcoin following these directions: <a href="https://github.com/PointCoin/pointcoind/wiki/Installing-PointCoin-on-AWS">Installing
  PointCoin on
  AWS</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup your node and wallet: <a href="https://github.com/PointCoin/pointcoind/wiki/Using-PointCoin-Binaries">Using PointCoin</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main goal for this part is for everyone to write your own PointCoin
miner.  We have provided some code in the <a href="https://github.com/CryptoCurrencyCafe/project2">Project 2
repo</a> for you to get
started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CryptoCurrencyCafe/project2/blob/master/miner.go">miner.go</a> - an initial template for a PointCoin miner.
  You will implement your miner by modifying this file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CryptoCurrencyCafe/project2/blob/master/support.go">support.go</a> - some functions that you will find useful
  in implementing your miner.  (You are not expected to change these
  functions, but can change them if you want to.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we provide some hints that may be helpful in building your miner.</p>
<h3>Coinbase Transaction</h3>
<p>Although some people might mine cryptocurrency for purely altruistic
reasons, the main economic incentive for mining is that the miner who
finds a new block can add a transaction to that block transfering the
mining fee to their address.</p>
<p>We have provided the <a href="https://github.com/CryptoCurrencyCafe/project2/blob/master/support.go#L84"><code>createCoinbaseTx</code></a> function in <code>support.go</code> to
create this transaction.  In includes this code for setting up the
inputs and outputs of the transaction:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">tx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">AddTxIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">btcwire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">TxIn</span><span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="p">})</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In PointCoin, the mining reward is 1 pointcoin (see <a href="https://github.com/PointCoin/pointcoind/commit/5c81f47ea739baf7841cbc0e7b7c3aa06b986067">this
commit</a>
for how it was modified from how it is set in bitcoin).</p>
<p>If you want to receive the rewards for your mining efforts, you need to
set the address used in the coinbase transaction to be the address for
your PointCoin wallet.</p>
<h3>Merkle Root</h3>
<p>The block header contains the Merkle Root of all the transactions in the
block.  This should be all the valid transactions submitted to the
network, with your coinbase transaction added.</p>
<p>We have provided the <a href="https://github.com/CryptoCurrencyCafe/project2/blob/master/support.go#L196"><code>createMerkleRoot</code></a> function in <code>support.go</code> for
computing the Merkle root of a list of transactions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">createMerkleRoot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">txs</span> <span class="p">[]</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">btcwire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">MsgTx</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">btcwire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ShaHash</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">merkleRoot</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Creating a Block</h3>
<p>A block in PointCoin is similar to a block in bitcoin.  It contains a
header consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hash of the previous block</li>
<li>The hash of the Merkle tree of all the transactions</li>
<li>The difficulty</li>
<li>A nonce (32 bits)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the header, it includes the list of transactions.</p>
<p>We have provided the <code>CreateBlock</code> function in <code>support.go</code> to build a
block given these inputs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">CreateBlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">prevHash</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">merkleRoot</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">btcwire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ShaHash</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">difficulty</span> <span class="nx">big</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Int</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Mining a Block</h3>
<p>Of course, the block you create is unlikely to be valid with a randomly
selected nonce.  To find a valid block, it is necessary to find a nonce
such that the hash of the block header (with that nonce included) is
below the target difficulty.</p>
<p>The block nonce is a uint32 in <code>block.Header.Nonce</code>.  You can update
this value with a simple assignment to try a different nonce value.</p>
<p>The function
<a href="https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/master/wire/blockheader.go#L48"><code>BlockSha</code></a>
returns the Double-SHA256 hash of the block header, so you can compute
the hash of your block using <code>block.Header.BlockSha()</code>.</p>
<p>Because of the different ways numbers and hashes are represented, the
difficulty comparison is more awkward than one would like.  You can use
the provided <code>lessThanDiff</code> function to check if the returned hash is
less than the target difficulty:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">lessThanDiff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hash</span> <span class="nx">btcwire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ShaHash</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">difficulty</span> <span class="nx">big</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">bigI</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">blockchain</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ShaHashToBig</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">bigI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cmp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">difficulty</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you've succeeded in finding a good nonce, submit the block!</p>
<p>This code will submit the block (since <code>client</code> is setup as an RPC to
the node running on your own instance, it is submitting it to your own
node first, which, if the block is valid, will submit it to the rest of
the network):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>   <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">SubmitBlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">btcutil</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NewBlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">block</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="kc">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">nil</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// something failed</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that one reason your submission may fail is if the blockchain has
already advanced.  This would happen if another miner found and
submitted a block (that was received by your node) since the call you
made to <code>client.GetBlockTemplate(&amp;btcjson.TemplateRequest{})</code> to obtain
the previous block (used in the template header).</p>
<h3>Becoming a PointCoin Tycoon</h3>
<p>You should start by making your miner as simple as possible, and getting
a simple miner working before attempting to do anything more
complicated.  </p>
<p>If you are ambitious, though, there are lots of ways to improve the
performance of your miner (still running on the low-powered micro EC2
node).</p>
<p>Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Explore the tradeoff between frequently checking the network to update
  your block template, and computing lots of hashes (that might be
  wasted if the blockchain has advanced).  Your miner will not perform
  well if you update your template after every hash attempt, or if you
  keep trying until you find a good block without ever updating your
  template.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strike>Even the micro instances have more than one core.  You are
  missing out on a lot of potential mining power if you are only using
  one thread.</strike> Actually, micro nodes do not even give you a full
  core!  You will not get better performace on a micro node by using
  multi-threading, since you only have access to a single CPU core.
  Your EC2 node is actually being throttled by Amazon since it is
  sharing a physical node with other VMs, and your compute use will be
  throttled if it is excessive (which a running miner should be!).  You
  may be able to use this to your advantage (since everyone elses miner
  is also running on a micro node, except possible course staff miners
  which get an unfair computing power advantage!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="problem"> 
<strong>Problem 1.</strong> Use your miner to acquire PointCoin.  You will receive
  full credit for <strike>acquiring at least 100 PointCoin</strike> successfully mining at least one block.
   </div></p>
<p>(Note the revision to Problem 1.  The original target of acquiring 100
PointCoin has been reduced because of the problems we had with the
intial PointCoin network and need to relaunch.  It is sufficient now to
mine one block successfully.  Earning more PointCoin will still be
beneficial though!  You'll have other opportunities to use it.)</p>
<p><div class="problem"> 
<strong>Problem 2.</strong> Estimate the cost of mining PointCoin given the current
difficulty level, and assuming you are using your mining code running on
an EC2 node.  A good answer would include an analysis of the expected
number of hashes that must be computed for a given difficulty level.<br />
   </div></p>
<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 3.</strong> What prevents a greedy miner from transfering more coin
  to the miner's address in a newly found block by increasing the value
  of the output of the coinbase transaction?</p>
</div>

<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 4.</strong> Why is there an extra nonce along with the next block
  height included in the coinbase transaction?  (Hint: how is the
  coinbase transaction different from normal transactions?)</p>
</div>

<p>Submit the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/nz3WSwVPU4">Project 2/Part 1 Submission
Form</a> (by 11:59pm on <strong>Sunday, 22
February</strong>).  (You can submit your answers to Problems 1-4 above either
by submitting text in the form, or submitting a link to a PDF containing
all of your answers).</p>
<h1>Part 2: Investigating Mining</h1>
<p><div class="exercise">
In Part 2, we'll explore attacks on the PointCoin network.  You should not attempt to actually launch any attacks until after class on <strong>Monday, 23 February</strong>.
   </div></p>
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>For Part 2 of this assignment, everyone should their own submission.
You may work with others in the class (indeed, part of your goal for
part 2 is to form a mining coallition with enough power to disrupt the
normal behavior of the network).  For the written and coding problems,
it is okay to collaborate with other students to write up one answer and
submit the same answer so long as you clearly credit the students who
you worked with, you fully contributed to the answer, and you fully
understand everything in the answers you submit.</p>
<p>You should write up answers to the questions 5-9 as a PDF file, and
submit it by sending an email to <em>evans@cs.virginia.edu</em> with subject line <code>Project 2 Submission</code>.</p>
<h2>Analyzing the Double Spending Attack</h2>
<p>For this problem, your goal is to analyze how much of a threat it is for
one miner (or pool controlled by a single authority) to control a large
faction of the hashing power.</p>
<p>Assume the attacker's goal is to get a victim to accept a payment (e.g.,
transfer pointcoin for cash-equivalent) that is valid in the (temporary)
blockchain, and then release mined blocks to replace that blockchain
with one that does not include the payment.  </p>
<p>You may assume (inaccurately!) that there is no cost to the attacker to
do the transaction.  That is, the attacker can create a transaction
selling <em>P</em> pointcoin for US dollars, and inverse that transaction (sell
the US dollars to buy pointcoin) at a future time, and end up with <em>P</em>
pointcoin after the two transactions.  (Of course, in any real financial
system, there are transaction costs.  A more realistic answer would
include this in your analysis.)</p>
<p>Your answer to problem 5 can either be a closed form mathematical equation, e.g.,
   <div class="indented">
<span class="math"><em>P</em>(<em>s</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span>
   </div>
giving the probability as a function of <span class="math"><em>s</em></span> (where you specify what the function <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> is, or a simulation in code (some procedure definition that can be called on a range of <em>s</em> values to give a good understanding of the success probability).</p>
<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 5.</strong> Suppose an attacker has <em>s</em> fraction of the network's
total hashing power.  What is the probability the attacker can
successfully execute a "51% double-spending attack" (as a function of
<em>s</em>) against a victim who accepts payment once the first block including
the transaction is accepted by the network (one confirmation).</p>
</div>

<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 6.</strong> Suppose an attacker has <em>s</em> fraction of the network's
total hashing power and the victim will accept a transaction only after
<em>b</em> blocks.  What is the probability the attacker can successfully
execute a "51% double-spending attack" (as a function of <em>s</em>) against a
victim who accepts payment once the transaction is accepted by at least
<em>b</em> network blocks?  (Note: for <em>b</em> = 1, this is the same as problem 5.
For larger <em>b</em>, this should give insight into how long a more paranoid
recipient should wait before accepting a transaction.)</p>
</div>

<h2>Forming Mining Pools</h2>
<p>Your answers to problems 5 and 6 should convince you that it is unlikely
that a single miner with less than 1/30 of the hashing power of the
PointCoin network will have a good likelihood of successfully
double-spending.</p>
<p>Develop a strategy for forming a mining pool.  You may collaborate with
as many students as you wish to develop your mining pool, but you should
be mutually distrustful of each other and you are encouraged to find
ways to take advantage of other students.  That is to say, the
effectiveness of your mining pool cannot depend on everyone behaving
honestly, but must take measures to prevent dishonest behavior in your
mining pool.  You may, however, assume that everyone can only use the
computing power of their own EC2 micro node for mining (and it would be
considered cheating to use additional power for mining).</p>
<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 7.</strong> Design a strategy for building a mining pool for
  PointCoin.  Your strategy should explain how you would incentivize
  others to contribute their mining power to you and ensure that they don't
  cheat (e.g., claim to provide more mining power than they actually do).
   </div></p>
<p>To actually execute your strategy, you should make it as simple as
possible (at least to get started), and then add more complexity only
after successfully accompilshing the simplest possible start.</p>
<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 8.</strong> Either implement your strategy for building a mining
pool, or join someone else's mining pool.  Explain what you did, and how
successful it was.  (We understand that actually building a successful
mining pool is both a significant technical and social challenge, so
don't worry if you are not able to do this, but you if not, should be
able to write up something interesting describing what you attempted and
what happened.)</p>
</div>

<h2>Free-for-All!</h2>
<p>For the last problem, your goal is to attack the PointCoin network in a
way that benefits yourself.  You can be creative on this and do not need
to limit yourself to attacks suggested in class or this page, but should
follow the rules below carefully and check with Dave before doing
anything questionable.</p>
<p><div class="problem"> </p>
<p><strong>Problem 9.</strong> Attempt to attack PointCoin in ways that are profitable
  to the attacker.  (Note that denial-of-service attacks should not be
  attempted.)  Full credit would be awarded for successfully executing a
  double-spending attack (against the only-a-little-bit-paranoid victim
  who accepts transactions based on the first block), but other attacks
  are valid and bonus credit will be due for any especially creative
  attacks.  Describe what you did, and if it is successful include
  evidence of the success.
   </div></p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The only rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You must disclose honestly everything that you did when you submit
the assignment (and in response to any questions before this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not do anything that violates any law or the University honor
code (although the normal "lying" and "stealing" provisions do not apply
to your nodes' behavior in pointcoin protocols or things you tell other
students in the class about your network activities).  It is considered
fair (indeed, encouraged) to "lie" or "mislead" your fellow students
regarding your mining behavior.  For example, it would be totally okay
and encouraged for you to attempt to trick others into joining your
mining pool by offering them a share of the points mined, but the not to
deliver those points.  For the purposes of this assignment, you should
consider your classmates to be mutually distrusting individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not use any computing resources for PointCoin mining other
than your one micro EC2 node.  (You may use other computing resources
for development, offline analysis, other computation, but not to
directly mine PointCoin.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not do anything with your EC2 node that violates Amazon's
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aup/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.  In particular,
this excludes denial of service attacks or both other students' nodes
and the staff nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not do anything a reasonable person would consider
harmful, unethical, or in violation of the spirit of this assignment.
This is a very vague statement.  What it really means is that if you are
uncertain about whether something you plan to do is consistent with the
spirit of this project, you should consult with Dave before doing it.
Examples of things that would be clearly unacceptable include installing
malware on another student's computer or using physical access to their
machine to copy or modify key files (or any other data) on their
machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
