## Schedule 

   <div class="todo">

- If you didnœôòùt get full credit for Project 1 because of failure to post
  something interesting, you can (and should!) redeem yourself and earn
  full credit by **posting an interesting comment by Thursday**.  It can
  be on (1) Discussion questions from Project 1 (2) notes from classes,
  or (3) general forum.

- **Read:** [_Chapter 6: The Bitcoin
Network_](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc),
[_Chapter 7: The
Blockchain_](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc)
from Andreas Antonopoulos' book.  (Ideally, you should finish these
before Wednesday's class, but at the latest by Monday, 9 Feb.)

# Proof-of-Work

Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.  [_Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail_](|filename|./pvp.pdf), CRYPTO 1992.

**Pricing Function**: (<span class="math">_f_</span>)
- moderately easy to compute
- cannot be amortized 
- computing <span class="math">_f_(_m_<sub>1</sub>), ..., _f_(_m_<sub>l</sub>)</span> costs <span class="math">_l_</span> times as much as computing <span class="math">_f_(_m_<sub>i<sub>)</span>. 
- easily verified: given <span class="math">_x_</span>, <span class="math">_y_</span> easy to check <span class="math">_y_ = _f_(_x_)</span>.

Adam Back. [_Hash Cash Postage Implementation_](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt)

**Interactive Hashcash**:  
1. Sender to Receiver: `Hello`  
2. Receiver to Sender: <span class="math">_r_</span> (random nonce)  
3. Sender to Receiver: <span class="math">_x_</span>, `Mail` where <span class="math">_x_ = _f_(_r_)</span>.  
4. Receiver verifies <span class="math">_x_ = _f_(_r_)</span>.  

How well does this protocol work for sending mail?
<div class="gap">

Suppose we use SHA-256 for <span class="math">_f_</span>?

How can we make this protocol non-interactive?

# Bitcoin Mining

Proof-of-work: Find an <span class="math">_x_</span> such that: SHA-256(SHA-256(<span class="math">_r_</span> + <span class="math">_x_</span>)) < <span class="math">_T_/_d_</span>.

<span class="math">_d_</span> is the "difficulty" (varies).  
<span class="math">_T_</span> is a fixed target (256-bit number).  
<span class="math">_r_</span> depends on hash of previous block, transactions, and other information.

What does it mean for the bitcoin difficulty to go down?

[BitcoinMiner](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/miner.cpp) (code from core Bitcoin implementation)

```c
//
// ScanHash scans nonces looking for a hash with at least some zero bits.
// The nonce is usually preserved between calls, but periodically or if the
// nonce is 0xffff0000 or above, the block is rebuilt and nNonce starts over at
// zero.
//
bool static ScanHash(const CBlockHeader *pblock, uint32_t& nNonce, uint256 *phash)
{
    // Write the first 76 bytes of the block header to a double-SHA256 state.
    CHash256 hasher;
    CDataStream ss(SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
    ss << *pblock;
    assert(ss.size() == 80);
    hasher.Write((unsigned char*)&ss[0], 76);

    while (true) {
        nNonce++;

        // Write the last 4 bytes of the block header (the nonce) to a copy of
        // the double-SHA256 state, and compute the result.
        CHash256(hasher).Write((unsigned char*)&nNonce, 4).Finalize((unsigned char*)phash);

        // Return the nonce if the hash has at least some zero bits,
        // caller will check if it has enough to reach the target
        if (((uint16_t*)phash)[15] == 0)
            return true;

        // If nothing found after trying for a while, return -1
        if ((nNonce & 0xfff) == 0)
            return false;
    }

[BitcoinMiner](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/miner.cpp#L438): (excerpted, most error checking code removed)

            unsigned int nTransactionsUpdatedLast = mempool.GetTransactionsUpdated();
            CBlockIndex* pindexPrev = chainActive.Tip();

            auto_ptr<CBlockTemplate> pblocktemplate(CreateNewBlockWithKey(reservekey));
            CBlock *pblock = &pblocktemplate->block;
            IncrementExtraNonce(pblock, pindexPrev, nExtraNonce);

            int64_t nStart = GetTime();
            arith_uint256 hashTarget = arith_uint256().SetCompact(pblock->nBits);
            uint256 hash;
            uint32_t nNonce = 0;
            while (true) {
                // Check if something found
                if (ScanHash(pblock, nNonce, &hash))
                {

                if (nNonce >= 0xffff0000) break;
                // ... other breaking conditions elided
                // Update nTime every few seconds
