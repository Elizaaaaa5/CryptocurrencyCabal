Title: Class 16: Alternate Cryptocurrencies
Date: 2015-03-15

## Project Proposals

**Project Proposals** are due **Thursday, 19 March** (11:59pm).  Send
  your proposal by email to <a
  href="mailto:evans@virginia.edu"><em>evans@virginia.edu</em></a> with
  subject line `Project Proposal`.  Your email should contain at least:

1. Title of your Proposal - a short title that should get across what you are doing.

2. Team members list - a list of everyone on your team.  You should
`cc:` all the team members in the email so I have one email to reply-all
to that will reach your full tem.

3. Motivation - explanation of why your project topic is worthwhile.

4. Project Plan - what you plan to do.

5. First deliverable - description of what you will have ready to submit
for the first deadline, **Sunday, 5 April** (note that you will be
presenting about your project in class on **Wednesday, 1 April**).

If you are looking for teammates for your project, or searching for a
project idea, come to my office hours after class today if possible.

## Alternate Cryptocurrencies

How can decentralized cryptocurrencies be different from bitcoin?
<div class="gap">

</div>

Variations:

- Economics: deflationary vs. inflationary
- Proof-of-work: possible advantages of other proof-of-work mechanisms
- Consensus mechanism: majority of computing power vs. alternatives
- Scripting language for transactions: simpler vs. more powerful and expressive
- Parameters: speed of blocks, size of transactions

  
## Dogecoin!

What is a _key derivation function_?

</div>

Why is SHA-256 is horrible key derivation function today?

What is a _memory-hard_ algorithm?
<div class="gap">

</div>

Is a memory-hard algorithm better for a cryptocurrency proof-of-work
than a compute-intensive one like SHA-256?

#### Interesting Video

If you're still looking for ideas for your project still, this video may give you some good ideas:
[_What Satoshi Didn't Know_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ3e1Pzu7iI), Gavin Anderson, DevCore Boston 2015.  (This talk gets into the history of bitcoin and lots of issues with flaws in its design, and raises some interesting possibilities for future work - e.g., are there ways to use old unspent transactions to solve network problems without spending them?)
