# Pegged Sidechains

bitcoin's consensus - all nodes must agree on valid transactions, otherwise fork!

any change that makes the set of valid transactions different is very
hard to deploy - need to get simultaneous agreement of all nodes or risk
fork

**Pegged sidechain:**

1. owner can move assets back and forth between sidechains
2. no risk of dishonest party blocking transfer
3. transfers are atomic - no failure can leave asses in both or no blockchain
4. sidechains are isolated - bug in sidechain only impacts assets that were transfered to that chain
5. blockchains are fully independent - can validate a sidechain
6. only need to track sidechains you are using

"one-way peg"

proof of burn in blockchain -> enables creation in sidechain
cannot transfer back to main chain

"two-way peg"

proof of possession in main chain, freezes asset
transaction in second chain that uses cryptographic lock as input - tied to original blockchain
