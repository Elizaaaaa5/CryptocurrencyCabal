Cryptocurrencies</em></a>.  (You can
use the free version of the book available at
<a href="https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook">https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook</a>,
but would probably benefit from buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Crypto-Currencies/dp/1449374042">printed
version</a>).
If you are not sure if you should prefer reading things on paper, you
should read <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=reading-paper-screens"><em>The Reading Brain in the Digital Age: The Science of Paper
versus
Screens</em></a>,
Scientific American, 11 April 2013.)  </div></p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>For the past 10,000 years, humans have been seeking better ways to store
and transfer value.  Cryptocurrencies (most notably bitcoin), provide a
way to do this using bits alone without any centralized authority.  In
this course, we will study the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, as
well as the political, legal, and economic issues they raise.</p>
<p>The class will be mostly lectures for the first half of the semester,
with about three problem sets that will involve a mix of math,
programming, reading, and writing (and of course, thinking).  For most
assignments, students will be expected to work individually or in small
teams.  The second half of the class will be more like a research
seminar, focused around student projects (done individually or in small
teams), and with presentations focused on research papers and other
interesting materials.</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment.</strong> Because of limited space available in the class,
instructor permission is required to register.  The course is open to
students in all majors, and I hope to have students with a variety of
backgrounds in the course, including some students with strong
backgrounds in economics, politics, and law.  There will be some
assignments that require significant programming work and computer
science background, but students who can contribute substantially to the
course may be allowed to enroll without that background (and assignments
will be adjusted in ways that make sense for these students).</p>
<h2>Expected Background</h2>
<p>Students entering this course are expected to be comfortable reading,
designing, and writing complex programs that involve thousands of lines
of code distributed over many modules.  You should be fairly comfortable
with math, at least enough to analyze probabilities.  </p>
<p>You should be comfortable learning how to use new programming language
features and APIs by reading their documentation (or source code when no
documentation is available), and not be surprised when solving
programming assignments requires you to learn a new language on your own
or to seek documentation beyond what was provided in class.</p>
<p>Students are not expected to have significant previous experience with
cryptography (although such background will certainly be helpful).</p>
<p>Some specific things I expect of students entering this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should have some experience programming in at least one
  programming language, and not be afraid of needing to learn new
  languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have written at least one program with over 1000 lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should understand basic probability and be able to figure out
  things like the probability that 100 tosses of a fair coin do not
  result in any tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should understand at least as much about complexity and
  computability as is covered in <a href="http://dori-mic.org"><em>Dori-Mic and the Universal
  Machine</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should find computing exciting and delighting, and believe you can
  use computing to make the world a better place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not satisfy any of these expectations, that doesn't mean you
cannot take the class, but you need to let me know about it at the
beginning of the semester.  </p>
<h2>Honor</h2>
<p>As a student at Mr. Jefferson's University, you are trusted to be
honorable.  </p>
<p>We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  In particular, students in this class are expected to
follow these rules:</p>
<p><b>I will not lie, cheat or steal.</b> If I am unsure whether something
would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing
it.</p>
<p><b>I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policy on each
assignment.</b> I will not abuse resources, including any submissions or
solutions for assignments from last semester's version of this course,
that would be clearly detrimental to my own learning.</p>
<h2>Other Expectations</h2>
<p>In addition to the honor rules, students in this class are also expected
to follow the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environment">HackerSchool social
rules</a> and these
behaviors:</p>
<p><b>I will do what I can to help my fellow classmates learn.</b> Except
when specifically instructed not to, this means when other students ask
me for help, I will attempt to provide it. I will look at their answers
and discuss what I think is good or bad about their answers. I will help
others improve their work, but will not give them my answers directly. I
will try to teach them what they need to know to discover solutions
themselves.</p>
<p><b>I will ask for help.</b> I will make a reasonable effort to do things
on my own first (or with my partners for group assignment), but will ask
my classmates or the course staff for help before getting overly
frustrated.  There are many ways to ask for help including the course
website and office hours.</p>
<p><b>I grant the course staff permission to reproduce and distribute
excerpts from my submissions for teaching purposes.</b> If may opt-out
of this by adding a comment to your code, but without an explicit
opt-out comment we assume you agree to it.</p>
<p><b>I will not invest money I cannot afford to lose in
cryptocurrencies.</b> The main topic of this course is cryptocurrencies,
and students will be encouraged to gain experience using bitcoin to
conduct real transactions (but will not be expected to spend any
personal money on bitcoin).  Please be aware that bitcoin is very
volatile, and that you could lose all the money in your bitcoin wallet
if you make a programming error or lose your key, so it would be foolish
and reckless to convert any money you would be upset about losing into a
cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><b>I will provide useful feedback.</b> I realize that this is a new and
 experimental course, and it is important that I let the course staff
 know what they need to improve the course. I will not wait until the
 end of the course to make the course staff aware of any problems. I
 will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course
 staff directly. <b>I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
 thoroughly</b>.</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>The course will have frequent short assignments (Problem Sets), 3 major
projects, and one open-ended project.</p>
<p>The problem sets generally will be assigned at class on Monday or
Wednesday, and due shortly after (sometimes as early as by midnight the
following day).  This will typically involve a short reading assignment
and some questions to answer, but may also involve short technical
problems.</p>
<p>The three major projects will involve writing programs and solving
problems to understand a bitcoin wallet (Project 1), bitcoin mining
(Project 2), and blockchain analysis (Project 3).</p>
<p>For the final project, you are free to work on anything relevant to
cryptocurrencies.  Some suggestions for project ideas will be posted on
the course website.</p>
<p>The registrar has scheduled an exam for this course on Thursday, 3 May
(2-5pm).  I do not anticipate using this time for a traditional exam,
but will use it for presenting final projects.</p>
<p>A tenative and (continually) updated schedule is available as a <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rmjagdrnmu3a9h2q5199lg4t28%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York">Google
calendar</a>.
(You can view this calendar on the course site, or incorporate in as
iCal calendar into your own calendar using <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rmjagdrnmu3a9h2q5199lg4t28%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">this
link</a>.
Except when noted otherwise, assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due
date.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>I prefer to spend my time focused as much as possible on <em>teaching</em>, and
as little as possible on <em>grading</em>.  The assignments in this class are
designed to maximize <em>learning</em>, rather than primarily for <em>assessment</em>.</p>
<p>That said, I understand that students do need to be assigned grades at
the end of the semester, and sometimes grades can be a powerful and
effective motivator.  Grades will be determined based on your
performance on the problem sets, projects, and class contributions
(including postings on the course site).  You should not be surprised or
upset if assignments are graded by randomly looking at selected answers,
rather than reading everything submitted.  There is no set weighting
among these things, and in general, if there is some combination of the
above that demonstrates that you have gotten what I hope out of the
class then you'll receive an A grade.</p>
