how is it possible to own something digital?

- copyright!

England

1662 - Licensing of the Press Act

guild of printers, "Stationer's Company" (formed in 1403, royal charter in 1557)
granted monopoly on printing [cf. Chinese granting monopoly on salt production]
exclusive right to print - responsible for censoring

ended in 1694 - no restrictions	       


Act of Queen Anne


## Cryptography

_kryptos_ is a Greek root meaning hidden ("secret")

_crypto_ + _graphy_ = "secret writing"

_Decryption_ is what the intended receiver does.  
_Cryptanalysis_ is what an attacker does.  

How are cryptography and security related?

### Simple Message Cryptosystem

Two functions:

- **Encrypt:** _E_(_m_: byte[]) &rarr; byte[].  The input is called the
    **plaintext**; the output is called the **ciphertext**.

- **Decrypt:** _D_(_c_: byte[]) &rarr; byte[]

Required properties:

- **Correctness:** for all possible messages, _m_, _D_(_E_(_m_)) = _m_
- **Security:** given the output of _E_(_m_), it is "hard" to learn anything interesting about _m_.

Their paper that introduced semantic security notions is:

formal security definitions or proofs in this class, but you should take
[Mohammad Mahmoody](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mohammad/)'s class to
learn them.)

### Keyed Symmetric Cryptosystem

Claude Shannon, [_Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems_](http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf), 1949 (work done during World War II, but declassified later).

Two functions:

- **Encrypt:** _E_(_<font color="red">k</font>_: byte[], _m_: byte[]) &rarr; byte[].  

- **Decrypt:** _D_(_<font color="red">k</font>, _c_: byte[]) &rarr; byte[]

Required properties:

- **Correctness:** for all possible messages, _m_, and keys, _k_, _D_(_<font color="red">k</font>_, _E_(_<font color="red">k</font>_, _m_)) = _m_
- **Security:** given _E_, _D_, and the output of _E_(_k_, _m_) it is "hard" to learn anything interesting about _m_ (without knowing _k_).

Are these properties enough to be secure against an active attacker?
