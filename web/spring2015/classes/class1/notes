Currency Properties
===================

What is currency?


Aristotle's [_Politics_](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1J7N4eAKuhwC&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PR13)

>

Without a medium of exchange, a group of _N_ people can have at most
_N^2_ transaction units.  With a medium of exchange, this becomes
effectively _2^N_.

Which of these properties are essential for a successful currency?


Which are desirable/undesirable?

- Universally Recognized (everyone accepts it)
- Stability (value doesn't change much)
- Divisibility (can subdivide into independent pieces)
- Anonymous (cannot tell who is involved in a transaction)
- Scarcity (limited supply, difficult to duplicate)
- Untracable (cannot trace through transactions)
- Centralized (authority controls money supply and integrity)
- Transferable (easy and inexpensive to exchange)
- Persistent (can't be easily destroyed)

How well does US paper currency satisfy these?
