# Problem Set 3:<br> CSI: Blockchain

   <div class="due">
Due: Sunday, 8 November at 8:29pm
   </div>

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is for everyone to gain experience analyzing
the blockchain and understanding of the anonymity of bitcoin (and
mechanisms that are used to increase or decrease it), and to hopefully
help the FBI catch some criminals.

### Collaboration Policy

For this assignment, you may either work alone or with one other person
of your choice.  If you work with a partner, you should together submit
one assignment with both of your names on it that reflects your combined
efforts.  You may, and are encouraged to, discuss all of the problems
with anyone else you want (both on-line using the course web site or any
other means you choose, and in person).

### Submission

Submit your answers as a single PDF file using [this
link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/oar0AQeg4SJRNtdHbcSS).  The name
of your file should be `<your email ID>-ps3.pdf` (if you worked alone)
or `<partner1 email ID>-<partner2 email ID>-ps3.pdf`

Your submission should include clearly marked answers for all the
problems (highlighted in yellow).  None of the questions require
submitting a program, although you may find it helpful to write programs
to develop your answers.  If the code you write is less than a page, it
is best to just include it in the PDF writeup.  If it is longer, you may
submit separate code files (and mention them in the PDF submission).
