# Notes

Litecoin boasts faster confirmations (2.5 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes). Does this help you gain confidence in a given transaction faster (at which point it is unlikely to be double-spent)?

Does Litecoin use scrypt because (a) scrypt is slower than SHA-256 or (b) the gap between ASIC and CPU performance for scrypt is believed to be narrower than that for SHA-256?  Would either be a good reason?

The **Ripple** network does not require any proof of work. In case of
Bitcoins, the adversary had to control the majority hashing power. What

The hallmark of the Ethereum network is a Turing-complete scripting
language. How does Ethereum prevent miners from being flooded with
CPU-intensive scripts?
