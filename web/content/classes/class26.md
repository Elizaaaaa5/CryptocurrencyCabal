_MAKING SECURITY USABLE (FOR A BILLION USERS)_
   </center>

How do you know if a website is "safe"? The security community puts
enormous effort into detecting malware, stopping the next Heartbleed,
and sandboxing bad content. Google Chrome's usable security team sits at
the front end of this work: we build the UI that tells end users what's
going on with their privacy and security. What you see as a single icon
might be the end product of months of work by engineers, designers,
security experts, and user researchers. I'll explain some of the
engineering and design challenges that we face, and give insight into
the day-by-day work done by a security team that serves more than a
billion browser users.

Bio: [Adrienne Porter Felt](http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/) leads
Google Chrome's usable security team, whose goal is to help people make
safe decisions while using Chrome. Along with her team, Dr. Felt is
responsible for building and improving the security warnings,
indicators, and settings that you see in Chrome today. Previously, Dr.
Felt was a research scientist on Google's security research team, where
she examined how browser users react to security warnings. She received
a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, and a BS from the University
of Virginia in 2008.

# Slides

The slides below include all the Jeopardy questions, even ones we didn't
get to in class.  You shouldn't expect to get asked trivia questions in
the oral final exam (and will not be asked to phrase your answers in the
form of a question!), but some of the substantive questions here would
make good questions to ask during the exam (in particular, I'd recommend
looking at the unused questions in Unlocking Script and Crypto Curves as
good potential exam questions).
