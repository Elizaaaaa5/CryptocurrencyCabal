# Checkup 2

[Checkup 2 (PDF)](/checkup2.pdf)

As was suggested in class today, there won't be an immediate opportunity
to submit revisions for this (like there was for Checkup 1), but there
will be some opportunity to improve your checkup result given in
Monday's class.

# Energy

[Mining Hardware](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison)
- current ASIC miners achive >5 Billion hashes per seconds and over 1500
Million hashes per Joule (the energy required to lift an apple one
meter).

[Antminer S5+](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1152746.0)
(here's the specs on the mining hardware we looked at in class)

[_Inside a Chinese Bitcoin Mine_](http://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-chinese-bitcoin-mine/), The Coinsman, 11 August 2014.

> The first thing you notice as you approach the warehouse is the noise. It begins as soon as you step out of the car, at which point it sounds like massive swarm of angry bees droning away somewhere off in the distance. It becomes louder and louder the closer you get to the building, and as you step through the doors it becomes a deafening and steady roar...

Our nearest nuclear plant, the [North Anna Power
Station](https://www.dom.com/corporate/what-we-do/electricity/generation/nuclear/north-anna-power-station)
(Lake Anna) generates 1892 MW, "enough to power 450,000 homes" or about
9x the amount needed to power the current bitcoin network (only counting
the miners themselves; additional power needed for cooling, etc.)

Is it financially lucrative to mine bitcoin in your residencev?

<div class="gap"></div>

(**Caveat:** despite the very rough estimate from class today, we are
not recommending anyone invest in bitcoin mining!)

How does the energy use of bitcoin compare to what is used by the
current financial infrastructure for comparable service?  (This is a
very difficult question to answer, would be a good project idea, not
something to answer in the blank below!)
