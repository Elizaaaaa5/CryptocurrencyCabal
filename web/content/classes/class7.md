- Satoshi Nakamoto, [_Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
System_](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), 2008.  The is the original

# Blockchain in the News

[_Nine of the Worldâ€™s Biggest Banks Form Blockchain Partnership_](http://recode.net/2015/09/15/nine-of-the-worlds-biggest-banks-form-blockchain-partnership/), Re/Code, 15 Sept 2015.

What are potentially misleading sources of _trust_?

What mechanisms have humans evolved or constructed to enhance trust among strangers?

# Distributed Consensus

How well does the 2-out-of-3 network consensus public ledger protocol work?
<div class="gap"></div>


# Proof-of-Work

Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.  [_Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail_](http://bitcoin-class.org/0/classes/class6/pvp.pdf), CRYPTO 1992.

**Pricing Function**: (<span class="math">_f_</span>)
- moderately easy to compute
- cannot be amortized 
- computing <span class="math">_f_(_m_<sub>1</sub>), ..., _f_(_m_<sub>l</sub>)</span> costs <span class="math">_l_</span> times as much as computing <span class="math">_f_(_m_<sub>i<sub>)</span>. 
- easily verified: given <span class="math">_x_</span>, <span class="math">_y_</span> easy to check <span class="math">_y_ = _f_(_x_)</span>.

Adam Back. [_Hash Cash Postage Implementation_](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt)

**Interactive Hashcash**:  
1. Sender to Receiver: `Hello`  
2. Receiver to Sender: <span class="math">_r_</span> (random nonce)  
3. Sender to Receiver: <span class="math">_x_</span>, `Mail` where <span class="math">_x_ = _f_(_r_)</span>.  
4. Receiver verifies <span class="math">_x_ = _f_(_r_)</span>.  

How well does this protocol work for sending mail?
<div class="gap"></div>

How can we make this protocol non-interactive?
<div class="gap"></div>

# Bitcoin Mining

Proof-of-work: Find an <span class="math">_x_</span> such that: SHA-256(SHA-256(<span class="math">_r_</span> + <span class="math">_x_</span>)) < <span class="math">_T_/_d_</span>.

<span class="math">_d_</span> is the "difficulty" (varies).  
<span class="math">_T_</span> is a fixed target (256-bit number).  
<span class="math">_r_</span> depends on hash of previous block, transactions, and other information.

What does it mean for the bitcoin difficulty to go down?
