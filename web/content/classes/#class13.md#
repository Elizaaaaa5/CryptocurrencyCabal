[Tom Duke's Bio](http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/FHPbI/1378405)  

The Congressional Research Service report he mentioned: [_Bitcoin:
Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal
Issues_](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43339.pdf), 14 August
2015. This provides a good summary of US laws and regulations that apply
