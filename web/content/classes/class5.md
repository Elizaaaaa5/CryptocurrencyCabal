## Notes

What does it mean for a problem to be _hard_?
<div class="gap"></div>

If you know an algorithm with running time in <span class="math">_O_(2<sup>_n_</sup>)</span> for problem _P_, what do you know about the hardness of problem _P_?
<div class="gap"></div>

What are the most common reasons for cryptosystems to fail in practice?

We didn't get to this in class, but will cover it in a future class.

## Bitcoin's Curve

Standards for Efficient Cryptography: [_SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters_](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf) (Certicom Research, 27 January 2010)

> _Verifiably random parameters offer some additional conservative features. These parameters are
> chosen from a seed using SHA-1 as specified in ANSI X9.62 [X9.62]. This process ensures that
> the parameters cannot be predetermined. The parameters are therefore extremely unlikely to
> be susceptible to future special-purpose attacks, and no trapdoors can have been placed in the
> parameters during their generation. When elliptic curve domain parameters are chosen verifiably
> at random, the seed S used to generate the parameters may optionally be stored along with the
> parameters so that users can verify the parameters were chosen verifiably at random._

What does it mean for parameters to be "verifiably random"?

# Randomness

**Kolmogorov Complexity:** <span class="math">_K_(_s_)</span> = the length of the shortest description of <span class="math">_s_</span>.

**Kolmogorov's Definition of Random:** A sequence <span
  class="math">_s_</span> is random, if <span class="math">_K_(_s_) =
  |_s_| + _C_</span>

Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit

<span class="math">_P_</span> and <span class="math">_Q_</span> are points on the curve, specified by the standard (but not
explained how <span class="math">_Q_</span> is choosen).  <span class="math">_P_</span> is a generator, so there exists some
<span class="math">_e_</span> such that <span class="math">_Q_<sup>_e_</sup> = _P_</span>.

<span class="math">_s_<sub>0</sub> = </span> initialize with seed randomness

<span class="math">_o_<sub>_i_</sub> =</span> the low-order 16 bits of the <span class="math">_x_</span>-coordinate of <span class="math">_r_<sub>_i_</sub></span>.

Standards_](http://www.ams.org/notices/201502/rnoti-p165.pdf), Notices
of the American Mathematical Society, February 2015.

Wertheimer's letter is an attempt to respond to [_Mathematicians Discuss the
Snowden Revelations_](http://www.ams.org/notices/201406/rnoti-p623.pdf).

> _The recent revelations about the NSAâ€™s spying
programs are both dismaying and encouraging.
What is encouraging is that they might lead not
just to a reform of the intelligence agencies but
also to a more serious look at what the ongoing
and inevitable erosion of privacy is doing to our
society. What is dismaying is less the intrusive data
collection itself and more what it reveals about the
decision-making processes inside the government._ (Andrew Odlyzko)


How satisfying is the NSA's response?  Are you more dismayed or encouraged?
