[_21 Inc. Releases First Product, a 'Bitcoin Computer'_](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/09/21/21-inc-releases-first-product-a-bitcoin-computer/), Wall Street Journal, 21 September 2015.

21 Inc. has been very well funded, but pretty opaque about what they are
actually doing.  They have designed some custom mining hardware, but
hard to see how it makes sense as a USB device for individuals.  I could
see the value in a secure USB device that works as a bitcoin wallet and
can be smoothly integrated with a web client, but hard to see the case
for including a miner in it.

You can buy it from
