There's an article in the New Yorker, [_Inside the Fight Over Bitcoin’s
Future_](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/inside-the-fight-over-bitcoins-future),
25 August 2015 (by Maria Bustillos) about the split over the
increasingly heated debate in the bitcoin community over the maximum
size of a block.

The current maximum size accepted by the Bitcoin Core node
software is 1MB (which means the network can support only approximately
7 transactions per second).  There are lots of proposed solutions to
this, including increasing the block size, but they are controversial
and also raise lots of issues about how to make decisions like this for
a decentralized system.
