The [latest episode of Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/story/darkode/)
starts with a story about bitcoin being used in a ransom scam
(CryptoLocker).  Its a sad story, without a lot of technical insights,
but does give a sense of what the bitcoin experience is like for many
people today.  A good thing to think about for a potential project is
how to solve the problem ---- making it so bitcoin can't be used to
collect ransom untracably, without losing the desirable aspects of
anonymity and decentralization.
