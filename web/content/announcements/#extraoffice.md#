There will be some additional office hours next week:

- Tuesday, 2-3:30pm (Dave, Rice 507) **(Added)**
- Tuesday, 3:30-4:30pm (Samee, Rice 442) **(Added)**
- Wednesday, 3:30-4:30pm (Samee, Rice 442)
- Thursday, 2:30-3:30 (Dave, Rice 507)

I hope these will be helpful in preparing for the midterm, as well as
for discussing project ideas.
