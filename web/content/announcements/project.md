**Project Pre-Proposals** are due **Friday (November 13) at 8:29pm**.  

Your pre-proposal should include the following information:

1. Names of everyone on the project team - you may work on your own, or
with any number of teammates.  The expected impressiveness of your
project should scale at least as the square root of the number of
project members.

2. Title of your project - a short title that gets across what your
project is about.

3. Idea for your project - one or two paragraphs that explain what
the purpose of your project is and what you plan to do.

4. Expected outcome - what you hope will be the outcome of your
project. This should explain what you expect to be able to deliver by
the end of semester, and how the world will benefit from it.

5. Related work - list of projects (which could include papers,
companies, etc.) that had goals related to yours.  You do not have to
have studied these in detail yet, but should have identified starting
points to look at.

6. Immediate plans - what are the next steps you plan to do.

Please submit this as a plain text email to
<em>ccc-staff@cs.virginia.edu</em>.  

Your email should have as its subject line: <b>Project:
<em>Title</em></b> where <em>Title</em> is the title of your project.
It should include all team members as cc'd recipients.  It should
include your answers to the six points above, clearly numbered.  Do not
use any PDF attachments unless it is really necessary to provide a
figure for your idea to be understandable.
