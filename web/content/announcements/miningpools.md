Here's the up-to-date graph of hashing power distributed by mining pools
(that I wasn't able to find in class Monday):

Looking at the current results for the past for days, more than 50% of
the hashing power appears to be held by just three mining pools: F2Pool
(20%), BitFury (17%), and AntPool (17%).  Each of these has around 75
PH/s (one peta-hash means 10<sup>15</sup> computations of the bitcoin
block hashing function, which actually involves two computations of
SHA-256).  

We'll talk about mining a lot more in the coming weeks to get a good
understanding of what this means technically, as well as the
implications for the blockchain.
