[Problem Set 2]({{< relref "ps/ps2.md" >}}) is now posted, and is due
Friday, 9 October (8:29pm).  Sorry it took so long to post this!

The other thing I hope everyone thinks about over "reading break", is
ideas for a course project.  You can see projects from the course last
Spring here:
[http://bitcoin-class.org/0/cryptocurrency-projects.html](http://bitcoin-class.org/0/cryptocurrency-projects.html).
Your project can be anything related to cryptocurrencies or the tools we
learn about in this class, and can be done individually or with a team
(the size of the project should scale approximately with the square root
of the team size).  If you have an idea for an ambitious project that
you want to start early, it may be possible to arrange for it to substitute for some other course assignments.
