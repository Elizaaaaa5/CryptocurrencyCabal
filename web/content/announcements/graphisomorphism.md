title: "Is Graph Isomorphism Hard?"

Last class, we talked about using Graph Isomorphism as the basis for a
zero knowledge proof, based on the assumption that it is a
computationally hard problem to determine if two graphs are isomorphic.  

Yesterday, Laszlo Babai presented a result that claims a quasipolynomial
time algorithm for graph isomorphism (that is, shows graph isomorphism
is not a hard enough problem to use as the basis for a zero knowledge
proof).  

[Jeremy Kun's summary of Babai's presentation](http://jeremykun.com/2015/11/12/a-quasipolynomial-time-algorithm-for-graph-isomorphism-the-details/)  
[_A Big Result on Graph Isomorphism_](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/a-big-result-on-graph-isomorphism/)

Note that this has no bearing on the zero knowledge proofs based on the
hardness of graph three-coloring, which, unlike graph isomorphism, is
know to be NP-Complete.
