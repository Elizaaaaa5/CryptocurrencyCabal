The email address, `ccc-staff@cs.virginia.edu`, reaches all the course
staff (Dave, Samee, and Ori).  If you have a question that can be asked
publicly, its best to post it as a comment on the website.  But, for
things that don't belong as website comments, use that email address to
reach all of us.  

I've updated the course calendar to include all the deadlines, and
encourage you to incorporate this into your calendar:
