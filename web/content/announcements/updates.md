The midterm was originally scheduled for Monday, October 19, but due to
the two guest lectures this week it will be rescheduled to be on
Wednesday, October 21.  

In class on Monday, October 19, you will receive a handout that sets up
and includes a few of the questions on the midterm (which you'll be
expected to work on before Wednesday, Oct 21, and will be able to bring
in written answers to that you will submit as part of the midterm).  The
rest of the midterm will be in class on Wednesday, October 21.  

If you have a problem with the schedule change and prefer to do the
midterm on Monday, October 19, this is an option.  You should contact
Dave or Samee to arrange this by Oct 14 at the latest.
