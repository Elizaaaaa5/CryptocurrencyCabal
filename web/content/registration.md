# Course Registration

   <div class="due">
Due: 8:29pm on Saturday, 29 August
   </div>

To register for the course, you need to **setup a bitcoin wallet** (so
don't wait until the last minute to do this).

[MultiBit HD](https://multibit.org/) is a good choice for this.  See
[https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)
for information on bitcoin wallets.  Be aware that you probably do not
have time to download the full blockchain before this assignment is due,
so need to use a _lightweight wallet_ (we will learn what this means
later in the class).

After creating a wallet, you should find the _Recieving Address_ which
you will need for one of the questions.  If you used MultiBit HD, you
will see this by clicking "Request" (to request payment), and copy the
"Recipient Address".  It should be a string like,
`19WmbY4nDcjAEv6wb5rcd5E6MutVMXBZzy`.  Note that your wallet may create
several recipient addresses, so you won't see the same address each time
you do this.

It is not necessary now, or at any time during this class, for you to
actually buy bitcoins with your own money.  If you are inclined to do
this, be careful, and don't use any funds you cannot afford to lose!
