**Wednesday, September 23**: Check 2 (was originally scheduled for Monday, September 21)

**Readings for next week** (should be completed by Monday, September 21 at the latest, but earlier is better):

System_](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), 2008.  The is the original
bitcoin paper, which is quite readable and historically interesting.

Network_](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc)

## Notes

What does it mean for a problem to be _hard_?

#


If you know an algorithm with running time in <span class="math">_O_($2^n$)</span> for problem _P_, what do you know about the hardness of problem _P_?

#


What are the most common reasons for cryptosystems to fail in practice?

## Bitcoin's Curve

Standards for Efficient Cryptography: [_SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters_](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf) (Certicom Research, 27 January 2010)

> _Verifiably random parameters offer some additional conservative features. These parameters are

What does it mean for parameters to be "verifiably random"?

#


# Randomness

**Kolmogorov Complexity:** <span class="math">_K_(_s_)</span> = the length of the shortest description of <span class="math">_s_</span>.

**Kolmogorov's Definition of Random:** A sequence <span
  class="math">_s_</span> is random, if <span class="math">_K_(_s_) =
  |_s_| + _C_</span> 

What is the Kolmogorov Complexity of the string `0001000010000011111111100111...`?

How likely is it that the parameters for the secp256k1 curve used by bitcoin have a trapdoor?

How should ECC parameters be generated for an important curve in a standard?

## Dual-EC PRNG 

\noindent
$P$ and $Q$ are points on the curve, specified by the standard (but not
explained how $Q$ is choosen).  $P$ is a generator, so there exists some
$e$ such that $Q^e = P$.

\noindent $s_0 =$ initalize with seed randomness  
\noindent $s_{i+1} = \varphi(s_i \times P)$

\noindent$r_i = \varphi(s_i \times Q)$
$o_i = $ the low-order 16 bits of the $x$-coordinate of $r_i$.

\noindent Given $o_i$, how much work is it to find all the possible $r_i = (x, y)$ values?

#
#


\noindent Given $e$, what is $\varphi(e \times A)$ where $A$ is a possible $r_i$ value?

Wertheimer's letter is an attempt to respond to [_Mathematicians Discuss the
Snowden Revelations_](http://www.ams.org/notices/201406/rnoti-p623.pdf).

> _The recent revelations about the NSAâ€™s spying
programs are both dismaying and encouraging.
What is encouraging is that they might lead not
just to a reform of the intelligence agencies but
also to a more serious look at what the ongoing
and inevitable erosion of privacy is doing to our
society. What is dismaying is less the intrusive data
collection itself and more what it reveals about the
decision-making processes inside the government._ (Andrew Odlyzko)
