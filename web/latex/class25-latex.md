## Project Final Presentations

The final project presentations will be in class on Wednesday, 2
December and Monday, 7 December.  The presentation will count for
approximately 50% of the grade for your final project.

The schedule of the presentations is below.  Each team will have **5 +
(_N_ - 1) minutes** to present your project (where _N_ is the number of
team members; so a 4-person team will have 8 minutes).  Your
presentation should be well prepared and enthusiastically delivered!

You should send a link to your presentation (PDF, PowerPoint, or
anything that works in Firefox browser) to ccc-staff before **11:59am**
on the day you are scheduled to present.  If your presentation includes
a demo that's great, but it needs to be designed in a way that can be
set up quickly and used effectively.

## Project Final Reports

To submit your final report, send an email to
_ccc-staff@cs.virginia.edu_ with subject line **Project Report:
_Title_** and cc-ing all of your team members.  The official deadline
for the final reports is **Monday, 7 December** (11:59pm), but
extensions will be granted upon request so long as extending the
deadline for this does not interfere problematically with your other
courses and responsibilities.

The email should be plaintext containing:

1. A title for your project (this is the title I will use on the public
page listing all the projects; add a <b>*</b> if it is different from
the title currently listed on [Project](/projects/)).

2. A one-sentence description of your project. This should be a clear,
well-written sentence that will be enough for someone to understand what
you did and why.

3. A URL that points to a publicly-viewable web page that describes your
project. The linked page can (and probably should) contain links to
other pages (e.g., a website that is your actual project or a github
repo with your project code). For example, the link you send could be a
link to http://my-project-site.org/about.html or
https://github.com/your-repo/README.md, which is a page describing your
project, as well as containing links to the main project site. Please
try to put your project site somewhere that will not expire when you
graduate from UVa, but that can survive forever.

4. Your project report, either as a PDF attachment, or a URL.  Your
project report should be a well-written and readable paper about your
project.  For most projects, this should include at least: (1) the
motivation for your project, (2) background, including a description of
related work (with references), (3) explanation of what you did, and (4)
your results.  For projects that do not involve building something, it
may make more sense for it to be a more integrated report.

## Discretionary Final Exams

By the end of this week, everyone should receive an email with your
status in the class (including feedback on PS3).  

The main message of this email will be guidance as to whether or not you
should schedule a final exam.  The main options are:

1. You're well positioned to get an **A** in the class.  So long as you
  do a decent job on the project, you'll get an **A** and don't need to
  do the final exam.

2. You are approaching what you need to do to convince us you deserve an
**A** in the class, but need do more.  If your project is outstanding,
that may be enough to make the case.  If not, you'll have a last chance
to do so by doing a final exam.  

3. From what you've done so far, we're not convinced you understand
cryptocurrencies well enough to earn an **A** in the class.  You should
plan on doing a final exam to convince us otherwise!

For students receving options 1 or 2, we'll try to give feedback on your
final projects are quickly as possible so you know whether or not a
final exam will be recommended.

The final exam will be an oral exam where you will explain how bitcoin
works, and then answer a few follow-up questions.  These will be
scheduled during the scheduled final exam time (Friday, 11 December
2-5pm) and other times.
