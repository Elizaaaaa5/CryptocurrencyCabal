## Notes

What is currency?


#
#


> _Every commodity admits two uses: (1) its proper use, (2) its use as an article of exchange._  
> Aristotle's [_Politics_](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1J7N4eAKuhwC&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PR13)

What is a _fiat currency_?


#


> _All these pieces of paper are, issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver... and indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold._  
> Macro Polo (on Yuan Dynasty paper money, 13th century)

Was salt a fiat currency as used by the Romans?  Was salt a fiat currency as used by the Han Dynasty?
